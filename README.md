# DNA Classification 
This Project will classify short E. Coli DNA sequences. Using a data set of 106 DNA Sequences with 57 sequential nucleotides (“base-pairs”) each, will be training several classifiers to classify the DNA sequences: 

-	Neural Net 
-	Support Vector Machine (SVM – Linear) 
-	AdaBoost

And by comparing the accuracy score and classification report of each model/algorithm, will be able to see which one perfume the best on unseen data.
